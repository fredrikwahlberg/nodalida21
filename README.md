## Abstract

Finding the year of writing for a historical text is of crucial importance to
historical and philological research. However, the year of original creation is
rarely explicitly stated and must be inferred from the text content, historical
records, and codicological clues. Given a transcribed text, machine learning
has successfully been used to estimate years of production. In this paper, we
present an overview of estimation approaches from the literature for historical
text archives, spanning from the 12th century until today.
